# Description
The purpose of this project is to provide an OpenMRS 2.x client for Android devices. The app is designed to cover most of the functionality currently on the web application.
The app communicates with OpenMRS instances using REST. It supports working offline (without network connection). The database on the device is encrypted and password protected to secure patient data.
For more information on the client, visit https://wiki.openmrs.org/display/projects/OpenMRS+2.x+Android+Client

#### Key Features
- Connect to OpenMRS server and sync all data
- Register and Edit patients
- Record Visits and Encounters
- View patient data (Details, Diagnoses, Visits, and Vitals)
- Offline access

# Development
We use JIRA to track issues and monitor project development. Refer to this link to view all issues and project summary: [Android Client JIRA](https://issues.openmrs.org/browse/AC). 
To get started contributing, try working on [introductory issues](https://issues.openmrs.org/issues/?filter=17165) in JIRA and check out [OpenMRS Pull Request Tips](https://wiki.openmrs.org/display/docs/Pull+Request+Tips).
Also, before creating a pull request, please run code review tools (Lint) and all tests.

### Code Style
The coding conventions used by OpenMRS are outlined [here](https://wiki.openmrs.org/display/docs/Developer+How-To+Setup+And+Use+IntelliJ#DeveloperHow-ToSetupAndUseIntelliJ-SetupCodeStyleAndFormatForOpenMRS). These can be applied to Android Studio by following the steps given below.
1. Install [Eclipse Code Formatter](https://github.com/krasa/EclipseCodeFormatter) plugin in Android studio
	I. Go to `Settings` > `Preferences` > `Plugins`
	II. Select Marketplace and searh for the plugin by name. 
	Then install it
2. Copy the required [XML](https://github.com/openmrs/openmrs-core/blob/master/tools/src/main/resources/eclipse/OpenMRSFormatter.xml)
3. Go to `Settings` > `Eclipse Code Formatter` and import the XML created in previous step
4. Now go to `Editor` > `Code Style` in the same window
5. Select `Java` in the menu on left and update values in `Imports` as shown in below picture
![Java:Imports settings](https://wiki.openmrs.org/download/attachments/3346739/Screen%20Shot%202017-03-02%20at%2013.01.04.png?version=1&modificationDate=1488438089000&api=v2)
5. Now select `XML` in the menu on left and update values in `Tabs and Indents` tab as shown in below picture
![XMLOther setings](https://wiki.openmrs.org/download/attachments/3346134/Screen%20Shot%202017-03-10%20at%2010.52.44.png?version=2&modificationDate=1489121590000&api=v2)


Please follow the below instructions while contributing:
1. When project is opened with Android Studio, go to `File` > `Settings` > `Editor` > `Code Style`
2. Select Project from the Scheme dropdown
3. Make sure that **hard wrap** is set to **125** for Java and XML language settings.


### Model pattern
We are following [Google's MVP sample](https://github.com/googlesamples/android-architecture/tree/todo-mvp) for this application's development.


### HTTP call debugging
In order to debug HTTP calls, we have integrated [Android Snooper](https://github.com/jainsahab/AndroidSnooper) (a GUI based open source library) to track network calls. To use Android snooper, all you have to do is shake your device and snooper will present list of network calls made by OpenMRS app.

# Quick Start

As of February 2016, this project has been migrated to gradle to work successfully with Android Studio.

### Steps to set up:
1. Fork the repository and clone your fork.
2. From the Android Studio menu select `File` > `New` > `Import Project`. Alternatively, from the `Welcome screen`, select `Import project`.
3. Navigate to the folder where you have cloned this repo and select the `build.gradle` file inside. Select `Import`.
4. Done! Wait for dependencies to load and download from Maven, then you're ready to go!
5. Make sure that you have the latest SDK and build tools downloaded, as we always build against the latest release.

[In-depth tutorial](https://github.com/codepath/android_guides/wiki/Getting-Started-with-Gradle)

Note:
- If you are working behind a proxy, check [this](https://wiki.appcelerator.org/display/guides2/Using+Studio+From+Behind+a+Proxy) to get things working.
- To start development on a local server, type http://10.0.2.2:8080/openmrs (for Android Studio AVD) or http://10.0.3.2:8080/openmrs (for Genymotion) as URL.

# Demo Server

The demo test server dedicated to the client is (https://demo.openmrs.org/openmrs/).

# Releasing [Collaborators only]

We follow the sprint model for development. Read more about it here: [OpenMRS Sprints](https://wiki.openmrs.org/display/RES/Development+Sprints).

To release the application, make sure to do these steps **in order**:

1. Update the [version variable in build.gradle](https://github.com/openmrs/openmrs-contrib-android-client/blob/master/openmrs-client/build.gradle#L21) prior to the release.
3. Update the [Release notes](#Release-Notes) section.
4. Update the [release notes text file](https://github.com/openmrs/openmrs-contrib-android-client/blob/master/openmrs-client/src/main/play/release-notes/en-US/default.txt) to publish in the Play store. Ideally change the wording so that normal end users understand.
5. Now commit with the title `Release <version number here>` to the master branch.
6. Tag the commit, using the version as the tag name. Make sure CI is green!
7. Go to [the releases page](https://github.com/openmrs/openmrs-contrib-android-client/releases) and click the [Draft a new release](https://github.com/openmrs/openmrs-contrib-android-client/releases/new) button. It will create a new version tag in the repository and build the app. The tag name will be used as the version number for this. Be sure to bump unfinished issues to the next due version.
8. Go to [JIRA's releases page](https://issues.openmrs.org/projects/AC?selectedItem=com.atlassian.jira.jira-projects-plugin:release-page), click on the three-dots on the right, and hit **Release**.
9. [Optional] Post a new Talk thread and describe what is changed or improved in the release.
