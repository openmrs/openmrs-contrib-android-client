# Description
The purpose of this project is to provide an OpenMRS 2.x client for Android devices. The app is designed to cover most of the functionality currently on the web application.
The app communicates with OpenMRS instances using REST. It supports working offline (without network connection). The database on the device is encrypted and password protected to secure patient data.
For more information on the client, visit https://wiki.openmrs.org/display/projects/OpenMRS+2.x+Android+Client

#### Key Features
- Connect to OpenMRS server and sync all data
- Register and Edit patients
- Record Visits and Encounters
- View patient data (Details, Diagnoses, Visits, and Vitals)
- Offline access

# GSoC 2017

The project has been selected as a candidate for Google Summer of Code 2017. Please visit the [Project Wiki Page](https://wiki.openmrs.org/display/projects/OpenMRS+Android+Client+Feature+Parity+and+Improvements+-+GSoC+2017) for more details.

The project was also a part of GSoC 2016, the details of which can be seen in the [GSoC_2016.md](GSoC_2016.md) file.

# Development
We use JIRA to track issues and monitor project development. Refer to this link to view all issues and project summary: [Android Client JIRA](https://issues.openmrs.org/browse/AC)
To get started contributing, try working on [introductory issues](https://issues.openmrs.org/issues/?filter=17165) in JIRA and check out [OpenMRS Pull Request Tips](https://wiki.openmrs.org/display/docs/Pull+Request+Tips). 
Also, before creating a pull request, please run code review tools (Lint) and all tests.

### Code Style
The coding conventions used by OpenMRS are outlined [here](https://wiki.openmrs.org/display/docs/Coding+Conventions).

### Model pattern
We are following [Google's MVP sample](https://github.com/googlesamples/android-architecture/tree/todo-mvp) for this application's development.


### HTTP call debugging
In order to debug HTTP calls, we have integrated [Android Snooper](https://github.com/jainsahab/AndroidSnooper) (a GUI based open source library) to track network calls. To use Android snooper, all you have to do is shake your device and snooper will present list of network calls made by OpenMRS app.

# Quick Start

As of February 2016, this project has been migrated to gradle to work successfully with Android Studio. 

### Steps to set up:
1. Fork the repository and clone your fork.
2. From the Android Studio menu select File > New > Import Project. Alternatively, from the Welcome screen, select Import project.
3. Navigate to the folder where you have cloned this repo and select the build.gradle file inside. Select "Import".
4. Done! Wait for dependencies to load and download from Maven, then you're ready to go! 
5. Make sure that you have the latest SDK and build tools downloaded, as we always build against the latest release.

[In-depth tutorial](https://github.com/codepath/android_guides/wiki/Getting-Started-with-Gradle)

Note:
- If you are working behind a proxy, check [this](https://wiki.appcelerator.org/display/guides2/Using+Studio+From+Behind+a+Proxy) to get things working.
- To start development on a local server, type http://10.0.2.2:8080/openmrs (for Android Studio AVD) or http://10.0.3.2:8080/openmrs (for Genymotion) as URL.

# Demo Server

The demo test server dedicated to the client is (https://demo.openmrs.org/openmrs/).

##### Demo Username: admin
##### Demo Password: Admin123

# Releasing

We follow the sprint model for development. Read more about it here: [OpenMRS Sprints](https://wiki.openmrs.org/display/RES/Development+Sprints).

In order to release the application, go to [releases](https://github.com/openmrs/openmrs-contrib-android-client/releases) and click the [Draft a new release](https://github.com/openmrs/openmrs-contrib-android-client/releases/new) button. It will create a new version tag in the repository and build the app. The tag name will be used as the version number for this release.

If you want to release a new major or minor version, please be sure to update the applicationVersion variable in [build.gradle](https://github.com/openmrs/openmrs-contrib-android-client/blob/master/openmrs-client/build.gradle#L26) prior to the release.
