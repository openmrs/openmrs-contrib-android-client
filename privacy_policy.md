## Data Storage
The app is meant for both offline as well as online use. Therefore, we store the data both locally on the device as well as in our servers.

## Security
We value your trust in providing us your personal information, thus we are striving to use commercially acceptable means of protecting it. But remember that no method of transmission over the internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure and reliable, and we cannot guarantee its absolute security. Some of the security measures taken by us are:

### Client Side

2.  Local database encryption – Uses [AES-256 Cipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard) (using a combination of username and password as its key)

### Server Side
1.  Patient’s Identifiers are validated using [Mod10](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luhn_algorithm) algorithm. This is used while creating new Patient’s Identifiers and avoid errors.
2.  Data is transmitted through a secure SSL connection
3.  Strings are hashed using [SHA-512](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-2)

## Data Retention

## Further Notes
